 ***DISCLAIMER***

 This codebase is a side project for a practice interview app. It is not intended for production use...yet. Much of the FE code in this app is produced by AI. **Expect serious inefficiencies and bad practices in the code.**

 * My current goal is to get this app to MVP.
 * I will refactor the code as needed to get the MVP out.

 ^^^ This was produced by AI. See what I mean?

 After MVP, I will come back and clean up the code, reducing inefficiencies and following best practices.

The components and functions that integrate with Supabase are entirely written by me. 

In order to run this project, you'll need to add the Supabase credentials to your `.env` file.
